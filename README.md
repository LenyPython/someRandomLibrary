# Random Library App

## Medium side project to learn TypeScript.
Side project that simulates a library app. It has two users states admin and user.
You can register and login using email from firebase/auth. Admin accounts can update data base(
Create, Read, Update, Delete book entries in library),
give admin privlidges to other users/accounts. They can also fetch book data from OpenLibrary API
and add them to DB by providing correct 10 or 13 char ISBN number.

Users can browse and borrow book. There is small 'reading screen' in 'My borrowed books' section.
(Read, Update)
